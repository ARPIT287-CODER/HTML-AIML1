   <DIV> <CENTER>IT IS A PAGE ABOUT WEB DESIGNING</CENTER>Web designing is the process of creating and structuring websites by combining visual elements, content, and interactive features to provide an attractive and user-friendly experience. It involves planning page layouts, selecting color schemes, choosing fonts, adding images or multimedia, and ensuring smooth navigation. A well-designed website not only looks appealing but also adapts to different devices (responsive design) and enhances accessibility for all users. Web designing often includes both creative aspects, like graphic design, and technical aspects, like coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its main goal is to deliver an engaging, functional, and efficient platform that communicates information effectively. </DIV> <br>
