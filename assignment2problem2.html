    <P>GitHub is a widely used, cloud-based platform that facilitates software development and version control, primarily utilizing Git. It allows developers to store, manage, and collaborate on code in "repositories," which serve as central locations for projects. Beyond just hosting code, GitHub provides a comprehensive suite of tools for collaborative development, including issue tracking, pull requests for proposing and reviewing code changes, and wikis for documentation. This platform fosters open-source contributions and team collaboration by enabling multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously, track changes, and merge contributions efficiently, ultimately enhancing code quality and streamlining the development workflow.</P>
